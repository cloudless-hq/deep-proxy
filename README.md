## potential libraries
- [x] https://github.com/CharlesStover/deep-proxy-polyfill
does not handle non existing properties
- [x] https://github.com/samvv/js-proxy-deep
unused code, example does not work (crashes)
- [x] https://github.com/alessioalex/recursive-object-proxy
does not handle get
- [x] https://github.com/cronvel/nested-proxies
seems most promising, does not handle accessing property of nonexisting key
- [x] https://github.com/vertexbz/recursive-proxy
too complicated
- [x] https://github.com/HiFaraz/proxyfull
